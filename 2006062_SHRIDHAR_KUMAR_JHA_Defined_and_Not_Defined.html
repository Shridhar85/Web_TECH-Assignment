    <h1>Difference between Undefined and Not Defined</h1>
    <h3>Check Console</h3>
    <h3>Explanation for the output in the console</h3>
    <p>The variable “a” will get space in memory, and by default, JavaScript assigns undefined to “a”. During the thread of execution, the “console.log(a)” will be printed as undefined. In the next line, we have assigned 6 to variable a. In the console, 6 will be printed. At the last line when JavaScript encounters the “console.log(b)” it searches for “b” inside the memory heap of execution context but it is not available, the JS engine will throw the “Reference Error” with a message of “b is not defined“. The JavaScript will stop execution when it encounters a reference error.
    </p>

    
        <script>
console.log(a);
var a = 6;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
    </script>
